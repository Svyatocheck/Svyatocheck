### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Svyat!

I'm a graduate student from Russia who has already done a bunch of cool projects in Python and Kotlin.

Now I'm preparing for an interview for a Backend developer position and studying Machine Learning in my spare time, as I want to make a career in this field in the future.
